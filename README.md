Vehicle Maintenance Prediction Business Understanding

The primary objective of this project is to predict the engine condition of vehicles based on sensor measurements to facilitate proactive maintenance and improve fleet efficiency. The dataset used contains crucial variables such as engine RPM, lubricating oil pressure, fuel pressure, coolant pressure, lubricating oil temperature, coolant temperature, and the corresponding engine condition.

Business Problem:

Efficient vehicle maintenance is vital for ensuring operational reliability and minimizing downtime, particularly in commercial and industrial contexts.
Predicting engine conditions in advance allows for timely maintenance scheduling, reducing the risk of costly breakdowns and optimizing fleet management.
Data Description:

The dataset comprises sensor measurements collected from vehicle engines, providing valuable insights into their operational status.
The target variable, "Engine Condition," indicates whether the engine is operating in a healthy state or requires attention.
Approach:

Data Exploration and Preprocessing:

Conduct comprehensive exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and relationships among sensor measurements and engine condition.
Address missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies to ensure data quality.
